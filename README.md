# [Hawkeye](http://hawkeyevision.tech/)

Hawkeye is a project that helps people with visual impairments visualize the world around them. It uses the AdHawk MindLink to provide essential visual information to the blind and visually impaired. Our application offers a wide range of functions.

## What it does

- **Text Recognition**: "Hawkeye" can read aloud whiteboard text, screens, and all text that our users would not otherwise see.

- **Object Identification**: The application identifies text and objects in the user's environment, providing information about their size, shape, and position.

- **Answering Questions** Hawkeye takes the place of Google for the visually impaired, using pure voice commands to search

## How we built it

We built "Hawkeye" by combining state-of-the-art computer vision and natural language processing algorithms with the Adhawk MindLink hardware. The development process involved several key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: We used open-source AI models to recognize and describe text and object elements accurately.

2. **Input System**: We developed a user-friendly voice input system that can be picked up by anyone.

3. **Testing and Feedback**: Extensive testing and consultation with the AdHawk team was conducted to fine-tune the application's performance and usability.

## Challenges we ran into

Building "Hawkeye" presented several challenges:

- **Real-time Processing**: We knew that real-time processing of so much data on a wearable device was possible, but did not know how much latency there would be. Fortunately, with many optimizations, we were able to get the processing to acceptable speeds.

- **Model Accuracy**: Ensuring high accuracy in text and object recognition, as well as facial recognition, required continuous refinement of our AI models.

- **Hardware Compatibility**: Adapting our software to work effectively with Adhawk MindLink's hardware posed compatibility challenges that we had to overcome.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're immensely proud of what "Hawkeye" represents and the impact it can have on the lives of blind and visually impaired individuals. Our accomplishments include:

- **Empowerment**: Providing a tool that enhances the independence and quality of life for visually impaired individuals. To no longer rely upon transcribers and assistants is something that real 

- **Inclusivity**: Breaking down barriers to education and employment, making these opportunities more accessible.

- **Innovation**: Combining cutting-edge technology and AI to create a groundbreaking solution for a pressing societal issue.

- **User-Centric Design**: Prioritizing user feedback and needs throughout the development process to create a genuinely user-friendly application.

## What we learned

Throughout the development of "Hawkeye," we learned valuable lessons about the power of technology to transform lives. Key takeaways include:

- **Empathy**: Understanding the daily challenges faced by visually impaired individuals deepened our empathy and commitment to creating inclusive technology.

- **Technical Skills**: We honed our skills in computer vision, natural language processing, and hardware-software integration.

- **Ethical Considerations**: We gained insights into the ethical implications of AI technology, especially in areas like facial recognition.

- **Collaboration**: Effective teamwork and collaboration were instrumental in overcoming challenges and achieving our goals.
